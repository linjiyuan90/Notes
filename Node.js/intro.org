 You can use Python much like PHP or Ruby, to build your
 run-of-the-mill web-app, whereas node is better fitted for
 applications where *live feedback* is important, due to its
 asynchronous model. You could for example have a ruby app handling
 your *CRUD load*, with nodejs/socket.io pushing live updates to the
 user. It's not a black/white situation.


Asynchronous IO
Django don't support RESTful ?


v8
virtual machine!

socket.io
express, a framework


node.js idleing
idle so it can handle concurrent connection
setInterval



The major speed increase is due to the fact that V8 compiles JavaScript
into native machine code, instead of interpreting it or executing it
as bytecode. 



*event model* instead of http's *request/response model*

client require *persistent connetion*
