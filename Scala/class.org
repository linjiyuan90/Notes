final field/class can't be inheritanced.
Any define '==' and '!=' as final, why?

* construct
** with trait
   Compile trait will generate a set of static methods. The code
   inside the Test object will be placed in the constructor first,
   then scala creates ="static forwarders"= (like the main method in
   trait).
   #+BEGIN_SRC scala
   trait Application {
     println("app")
     def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
       println("main")
     }
   }
    
   object Test extends Application {
     println("first print app, then this, main last")
   }

   // create a anonymouse subclass
   // val x = new Application {println("later")}
   #+END_SRC
** eary member definition
   solution to issues from previous versions of Scala
** lazy
