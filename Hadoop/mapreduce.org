if a mapepr will run too long (>= 600s), need to call
context.progress() to tell jobtracker the status.

** job
   : job.setSpeculativeExecution(false);  // set to false because we write to HBase
** ToolRunner
   ToolRunner will get the GenericOptions, so you don't have to parse
   it by yourself.
   : ToolRunner.run(tool, args);
