* Fair Scheduler


* Capacity Scheduler
  The CapacityScheduler is designed to allow sharing a large cluster
  while giving each organization a *minimum capacity guarantee*.

  The CapacityScheduler provides a stringent set of limits to ensure
  that a single job or user or queue *cannot consume dispropotionate*
  amount of resources in the cluster. 

  Also, the *JobTracker* of the cluster, in particular, is a precious
  resource and the CapacityScheduler provides *limits on
  initialized/pending tasks and jobs* from a single user and queue to
  ensure fairness and stability of the cluster.

  - with capacity scheduler, =mapred.cluster.map.memory.mb= means one slot,
    =mapred.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum= means number of slots in one node.
