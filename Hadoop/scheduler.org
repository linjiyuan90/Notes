* Fair Scheduler


* Capacity Scheduler
  The CapacityScheduler is designed to allow sharing a large cluster
  while giving each organization a *minimum capacity guarantee*.

  The CapacityScheduler provides a stringent set of limits to ensure
  that a single job or user or queue *cannot consume dispropotionate*
  amount of resources in the cluster. 

  Also, the *JobTracker* of the cluster, in particular, is a precious
  resource and the CapacityScheduler provides *limits on
  initialized/pending tasks and jobs* from a single user and queue to
  ensure fairness and stability of the cluster.
