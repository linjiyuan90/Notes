* Oozie
** two main parts
   - a workflow engine
   - a coordinator engine
** different with JobControl
JobControl runs on the client machine submitting the jobs, Oozie runs
as a service in the cluster.

** define an Oozie workflow
*** nodes
A workflow definition is a DAG with,
 - 6 control-flow nodes:
   - define beginning and end of a workflow (start, end, fail)
   - control the workflow execution path (decision, fork, join)
 - one *map-reduce action* node (map-reduce, pig, SSH, HTTP, eMail,
   Oozie sub-workflow.)
*** example
#+INCLUDE: "oozie-example.xml" example
*** parameterized
   - job-tracker
   - name-node
*** components
A workflow application is made up of the workflow definitions plus
all the *associated resources* (such as MapReduce JAR files, Pig
scripts, and son on).
** install
