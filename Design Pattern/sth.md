* The observer pattern is an alternative technique for handling changes to mutable objects.

# Factory
* creation of an object of the "appropriate" type, based on the type of an
  existing object, for example, generate appropriate kind of *HRInfo* for that
  type of *Employee*
# Prototype
* clone?
# Command
* when a function object is used as a callback, that's an instance of the
  `Command` pattern.
