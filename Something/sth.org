* component & service
  "A service is similar to a component in that it's used by foreign
  applications. The main difference is that I expect a component to be
  used locally (think jar file, assembly, dll, or a source import). A
  service will be used remotely through some remote interface, either
  synchronous or asynchronous (eg web service, messaging system, RPC,
  or socket.)"

* dependency injection
  The implementation is injected from outside?
  Being able to make this decision at run-time rather than compile
  time is the key advantage of dependency injection.
