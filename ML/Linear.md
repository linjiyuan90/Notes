For the set of linear classification methods, it is often difficult to learn a linear separator function using a relatively **low-dimensional feature space**.
By combining basic features, effectively increasing the dimensionality of each example vector x, we increase the chance of learning a linear function that separates all the positive and negative examples presented.
