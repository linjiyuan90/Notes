Redis can be used as a lightweight message queue by push/pop of the list.
However, it's not reliable. Since there is no confirm mechenism.  other mq
product like rabbitmq has this confirm mechnism to avoid message loss and
provide redelivery.

Note, publish/subscribe of redis can'be used as mq since if message will loss if
client is offline.
