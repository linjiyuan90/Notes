* Tags 								       :tags:
+ Assign tags for headlines for cross-correlating information.
+ Tags must be preceded and followed by a sinlge colon, e.g.,
  ':work:', ':work:urgent:'. *Tags occur at the end of the headline.*
+ tag inheritance
  - By default, if a heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will
    inherit the tag as well. org-tag-exclude-from-inheritance,
    org-use-tag-inheritance.
  - filetags
    : #+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:
+ [ ] Setting tags
  - at the end of a headling, after a colon, M-<TAB> offers
    completion on tags
  - C-c C-q 
    org-set-tags-command
  - C-c C-c
    org-set-tags-command, when the cursor is in a headline, this does
    the same as C-c C-q.
  - default tags for a given file

+ Tag searchs
  - C-c / m or C-c \ (org-match-sparse-tree)
  - [ ] C-c a m (org-tags-view)

    '+boss+urgent-project1'



* Properties and columns
A property is a *key-value pair* associated with an *entry*.
Properties can be set so they are associated with a single entry, with
every entry in a tree, or with every entry in an Org mode file.
** applications
   - properties like tags but with a value. 
     Maintaining a file where you *document bugs and plan rerleases* for
     a piece of software.
   - implement very basic *databases capabilites* in an Org buffer.
** properties syntax
   - need to be inserted into a special /drawer/ with the name *PROPERTIES*
   - each property is specified on a single line
     for example:
     #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     * CD collection
     ** Classic
     *** Goldberg Variations
         :PROPERTIES:

         :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
         :NDisks:    1
         :END:
     #+END_EXAMPLE
   - org-use-property-inheritance
     Also, set ':xxx\_ALL:' for ':xxx:' to be inherited
   - set property to be inherited by any entry in a file
     : #+PROPERTY: XXX xxx
   - add to the value of an existing property
     append a + to the propery name
     : #+PROPERTY: var foo=1
     : #+PROPERTY: var+ foo=2

other examples:
   : #+INCLUDE: "ch2.org" :minlevel 1
   : # make a file become a sibling of current top-level headline
   : #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "5-10"   Include lines 5 to 10, 10 excluded
   : #+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "-10"    Include lines 1 to 10, 10 excluded
