* permission
    
** user identity
   - groups [USERNAME]
    print the groups a user is in
   - adduser --ingroup <groupname> <username>

** access control
  - if you has r not x on a dir, you can list the filenames in the dir
    but can not list the files' statistics \\
    if you want to access a file, you must have *x along the path*
  - w on a file means you can modify the content of the file, not the
    filename or delete it. You need w of the file's directory to
    rename, create, delete file.


* Tricks
  - echo | g++ -Wp,-v -x c++ - -fsyntax-only
    this will send a *EOF* to it.
  - visudo
    : vi /etc/sudoers
  - su user, su - user \\
    The latter would provide an environment similar to what the user
    would expect had the user *logged in* directly. \\ 
    For example, load /etc/profile, and shift to home. So, it's recommended.
